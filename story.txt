Ciaran - 
I had a story idea that the town next to the tower is run by a mayor who has a heart of gold but is incompetent. 
The town is falling apart because of it so he hires someone to go into the tower (player character)
to get items to help rebuild the town. Normally no one goes into the tower because it is dangerous but 
desperate time. Then this story turns into gameplay mechanics, you go in tower, get loot, upgrade town
which upgrades player abiltiies. E.g. upgrade blacksmith for armour / weps. This then links into NPCs
asking for quests as part of the rebuilding etc. You could have it so the mayor prayed for help and 
that is why the tower appeared. It could be revealed later that the tower is some lovecraftian esque
monster so all the items you get to upgrade the town actually corrupt it. Could morph into the story
telling / game mechanics.

Me-
Could have it so the tower is completely normal to everyone and no one questions it 
(and the player wouldn't because it's a game), but throughout there'd be little one of subtle lines that 
the tower shouldn't be there and people subconsciously know something's wrong.
